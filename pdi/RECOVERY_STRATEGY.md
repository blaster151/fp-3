# Recovery Strategy: Lost Knowledge

## The Problem
Past feature implementations had valuable "oh, this would also be good for..." commentary that wasn't captured, leading to lost knowledge about potential use cases and improvements.

## Recovery Approach

### 1. Backwards Analysis
**Process**: Go through existing features and ask "What else could this be used for?"

**Method**:
- Review each major feature in the codebase
- Ask LLM: "What other use cases could this feature support?"
- Document discovered patterns in KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md

**Example**:
```
Feature: CanonicalJsonMap
LLM Analysis: "This could also be used for:
- Configuration management (canonical config keys)
- API response caching (canonical request/response pairs)
- Data deduplication in ETL pipelines
- Session management (canonical session keys)"
```

### 2. Pattern Discovery
**Process**: Look for recurring patterns that could benefit from existing features.

**Method**:
- Use ripgrep to find similar code patterns
- Ask LLM to analyze patterns for improvement opportunities
- Document findings in KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md

**Example**:
```bash
# Find manual cache implementations
ripgrep "cache.*Map|cache.*Set"

# Find manual deduplication
ripgrep "uniq.*Map|dedup.*Map"

# Find manual JSON key generation
ripgrep "JSON\.stringify.*key|key.*JSON\.stringify"
```

### 3. Systematic Review
**Process**: Periodically review the entire codebase for upgrade opportunities.

**Method**:
- Set aside dedicated time for "knowledge recovery"
- Use the "sandwiching" process on existing features
- Focus on high-impact, low-risk improvements

### 4. Documentation Recovery
**Process**: Capture insights as they're discovered.

**Method**:
- Keep a "RECOVERY_NOTES.md" file for temporary insights
- Regularly transfer insights to KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md
- Use the upgrade analysis process to validate insights

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Quick Wins
- Review recent features for obvious improvement opportunities
- Update KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md with discovered patterns
- Implement low-risk, high-benefit upgrades

### Phase 2: Systematic Analysis
- Go through each major feature systematically
- Use LLM analysis to discover hidden use cases
- Document all findings in KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md

### Phase 3: Integration
- Ensure new development follows the enhanced workflow
- Use token drift prevention to maintain context
- Regularly update knowledge base with new discoveries

## Success Metrics
- Number of existing features with documented alternative use cases
- Number of upgrade opportunities identified and implemented
- Reduction in redundant implementations
- Improvement in code reuse and consistency
