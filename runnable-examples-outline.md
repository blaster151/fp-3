# Runnable Example Concepts Outline

A ranked catalogue of the runnable examples implemented in the numerically prefixed modules under `examples/runnable/`. Each entry names the logical goal of the example suite so the code can be rebuilt later in a principled order. The suites can be executed via `run-runnable-examples.ts`.

## Typechecking workflow

- `tsconfig.prod-runnable.json` extends the production compiler settings while re-including the runnable example entry points (`run-examples.ts` and `run-runnable-examples.ts`) plus the catalogued modules under `examples/runnable/`.
- `npm run typecheck:prod:runnable` uses that configuration so CI can track the outstanding diagnostics without disturbing the existing production build.
- When a batch of examples is repaired, re-run the command above to confirm the typecheck delta before removing the now-unnecessary exclusions from `tsconfig.prod.json`.
- The current diagnostic snapshot lives in `TYPECHECK_RUNNABLE_STATUS.md`; update it whenever you land fixes so the team can see progress.
